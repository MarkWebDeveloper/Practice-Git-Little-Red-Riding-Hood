            <h2>1. The mother's task</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
            <p>One day her mother said to her, "Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing. And when you go into her room, don't forget to say, good-morning, and don't peep into every corner before you do it."</p>
            <p>I will take great care, said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.</p>

            <h2>2. Unexpected meeting</h2>
            <p>The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.</p>
            <p>"Good-day, Little Red Riding Hood," said he. <br><br>

                "Thank you kindly, wolf." <br><br>
                
                "Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?" <br><br>
                
                "To my grandmother's." <br><br>
                
                "What have you got in your apron?" <br><br>
                
                "Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger." <br><br>
                
                "Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?" <br><br>
                
                "A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood. Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below. You surely must know it," replied Little Red Riding Hood.</p>

            <h2>3. Criminal act</h2>
            <p>Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door. <br><br>

                "Who is there?" <br><br>
                
                "Little Red Riding Hood," replied the wolf. "She is bringing cake and wine. Open the door."<br><br>
                
                "Lift the latch," called out the grandmother, "I am too weak, and cannot get up."<br><br>
                
                The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.</p>

            <h2>4. Poor little girl</h2>
            <p>Little Red Riding Hood, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her. <br><br>

                She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much. <br><br>

                She called out, "Good morning," but received no answer. So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange. <br><br>

                "Oh, grandmother," she said, "what big ears you have." <br><br>

                "The better to hear you with, my child," was the reply. <br><br>

                "But, grandmother, what big eyes you have," she said. <br><br>

                "The better to see you with, my dear." <br><br>

                "But, grandmother, what large hands you have." <br><br>

                "The better to hug you with." <br><br>

                "Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have." <br><br>

                "The better to eat you with." <br><br>

                And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Little Red Riding Hood. <br><br>

            <h2>5. Justice</h2>
            <p>So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. "Do I find you here, you old sinner," said he. "I have long sought you." <br><br>

                Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. <br><br>

                When he had made two snips, he saw the Little Red Riding Hood shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, "Ah, how frightened I have been. How dark it was inside the wolf." <br><br>

                And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Little Red Riding Hood, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead. <br><br>
